                <h2>Flywheel Network Manager</h2>
            </div>
            <h4> Grid energy storage is a rapidly developing field and finding new ways to store energy in times of
                excess production is key to improving grid efficiency.</h4>
            <h4>Project Highlights:</h4>

            <li>Flywheel network tracking/storage, power outputs </li>
            <li>Customizable flywheel material, rotor shape, volume and network size </li>
            <li>Flywheel velocity monitoring using hall effect sensor-based arduino tachometer </li>
            <li>Application fully designed in C/C++ using Dear ImGUI front end framework</li>
            <li>This project gave me exposure to graphics rendering and the windows API</li>
            <br>
            <h4>To-Do's:</h4>
            <li>Multiple network/sensor handling</li>
            <li>Error logging system, critical error failsafes, fault tolerances</li>
            <li>UX: image rendering, drag&drop network visualization tool</li>
            <li>Integration of motor/generator with flywheel using live current</li>
            <li>A repository for this program can be found <a
                    href="https://github.com/mmcgui15/Flywheel_Network_Manager">here</a></li>

            <h2>Hot Potty</h2>
            <h4> Have you ever lived in the woods?</h4>
            <li>A very simple arduino project that senses temperature and activates a heating element in my off-grid
                toilet
                in the winter</li>
            <li>Keeps toilet functional by preventing it from freezing and exploding (again).</li>
            <li>Requires relay and power source for heating element</li>
            <li>Feel free to ask me how I got a flushing toilet to work in the middle of the woods. It was quite a fun
                project.
            </li>
            <li>Arduino INO file can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/mmcgui15/HotPotty">here.</a> </li>

            <h2>Pet Eclipse Project</h2>
            <h4> Do you want to know the exact date that you and your pet are the same age?</h4>

            <li>Programmed using Python</li>
            <li>Cats and dogs "age" faster in their earlier years, and different sized dogs have their own aging
                equations. Intercepts of piecewise functions were challenging to
                calculate, especially since leap-days are involved
                and do not scale evenly with "pet years".
            </li>
            <li>Easily adaptable to any species given aging relative to human years</li>
            <li>My cat Mags and I shared a Pet Eclipse Day on August 27/2018 when we were both precisely 25 years and
                136 days old.
                Unfortunately we did not celebrate</li>
            <li>Algorithm is completed, www.PetEclipseDay.com will be live soon!</li>
            <br>
            <li>Don't forget to celebrate your Pet Eclipse Day! Email me if you'd like to know your eclipse day
                is before the site is live!
            </li>
