        It's the summer of 2021. A the perfect time for a cabin-building/homesteading
        adventure in the woods of Grafton, New Hampshire. I manage to rope in some long lost friends crazy enough to
        join me on what ended up being one the most difficult and rewarding journeys of our lives.
        <br><br>
        The local townsfolk caught onto the crazy kids building a cabin in one summer on Wild Meadow Road. We made
        lots of new friends, both two and four-legged, who shaped our journey across the stream on Wild Meadow Road. My
        name is Mike, and I am joined by my good friends Shelby and Raven, but you can call us the Wild Meadow Boys.
