        To move massive logs without a tractor, we built a zipline. It took a few days of engineering and assembly,
        but ultimately it was able to move 1000lb logs with ease, and was theoretically capable of double. Riding
        the zipline in tree straps was just a bonus. We also used the trusty tripod to lift logs in difficult
        situations.

        One of our first projects was making furniture for my sister's wedding. After a month and a half straight of
        rain, we had just a few weeks to turn living trees into furniture. We started by making live edge pine benches
        birch stumps for the ceremony.

        The weather got cold very quickly in the fall, so we decided to halt all main cabin activity and focus on making
        a small, temporary cabin, which will be a guest cabin in the future. For more about our cabin construction click

        A look inside the cabin. The gaps visible between the logs were sealed just before the winter came to allow
        for maximum shrinkage. The lights, which run off a 12V deep cell battery, are a newer addition, and would
        have been much appreciated during the dark days of winter.

        We welcomed a variety of animals over the summer. Their cuteness outweighed my self-control and several days
        turned into emergency construction days due to a local animal housing shortage. We had a total of

        pigs, 8 ducks, 4 chickens, 3 humans and one cat before we had a permanent place to live. Oops...
